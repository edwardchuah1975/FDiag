{"name":"FDiag","google":"","body":"FDiag\r\n=====\r\n\r\nFDiag is a log-analysis toolkit that processes cluster system logs to generate event patterns for diagnosis of the sources and causes of recurrent system failures.  When given a symptom event, FDiag extracts message templates from the logs (syslogs, rationalized logs by J.Hammond et. al., Bluegene/L logs, Cray-XT logs), identifies statistical correlations between the given symptom event and the message templates, and generates sequences of events associated with a given terminal event.  FDiag is provided to the public under the GNU GPL license.  The current as well as future versions of FDiag will be hosted and maintained on Github at http://edwardchuah1975.github.com/FDiag .\r\n\r\nEarlier versions of FDiag were developed as part of an international collaboration between the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), the University of Texas at Austin, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), and the A*Star Computational Resource Centre (ACRC).  The source of the earlier version of FDiag can be obtained from this webpage: http://software.ihpc.a-star.edu.sg/projects/FDiag/FDiag.php .  This collaboration has also produced a number of papers:\r\n\r\n   _1. E. Chuah, S.-h. Kuo, P. Hiew, W.-C. Tjhi, G. Lee, J. Hammond, M. T. Michalewicz, T. Hung, J.C.

A demonstration of FDiag has recently been presented at the Workshop on Managing Systems Automatically and Dynamically.
