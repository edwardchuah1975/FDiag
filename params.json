When given a symptom event, FDiag extracts message templates from the logs (syslogs, rationalized logs by J.Hammond et. al., Bluegene/L logs, Cray-XT logs), identifies statistical correlations between the given symptom event and the message templates, and generates sequences of events associated with a given terminal event.\r\n\r\nEarlier versions of FDiag were developed as part of an international collaboration between the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), the University of Texas at Austin, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), and the A*Star Computational Resource Centre (ACRC).  The source of the earlier version of FDiag can be obtained from this webpage: http://software.ihpc.a-star.edu.sg/projects/FDiag/FDiag.php .  The current as well as future versions of FDiag will be hosted and maintained on Github at https://github.com/edwardchuah1975/FDiag .\r\n\r\nFDiag is a living toolkit for which there are several plans to extend FDiag significantly.  If you are interested in the development and/or use of FDiag, please contact me by email to discuss a possible course of collaboration.\r\n\r\nEdward Chuah (email: edwardchuah@acm.org)","tagline":"FDiag is a log-analysis toolkit that processes cluster system logs to generate event patterns for diagnosis of recurrent system failures.","name":"FDiag"}
